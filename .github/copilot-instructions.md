## IntelliFakeLens Project Instructions

This project is a full-stack web application for detecting fake/deepfake images using machine learning models like Xception.

### Project Structure
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript application with modern UI components
- **Backend**: Python Flask/FastAPI server for ML model inference
- **ML Models**: Pre-trained models like Xception for deepfake detection
- **Features**: Image upload, processing, detection, and explainable AI visualization

### Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety in React components
- Implement proper error handling for image uploads and processing
- Create intuitive UI for step-by-step detection explanations
- Follow best practices for ML model integration
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes
- Implement proper loading states and user feedback

### Key Features to Implement
1. Image upload interface with drag-and-drop
2. Real-time processing with progress indicators
3. Detailed detection results with confidence scores
4. Visual explanations of detection reasoning
5. Classical image processing artifact visualization
6. Educational information about deepfake detection
